#+TITLE: "What Docker Means" - A Presentation

This is a presentation that I will be giving at the Fox Valley Linux
User Group on 2/18/17. An online version can be found here:

The entire presentation should be self-contained. You can just clone
the repo and open =index.html= in a web browser. 

The only part of this presentation that's mine are (some) of the
images. All of the CSS and JS are courtesy of the [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][reveal.js]]
project. For more information please read the presentation.
